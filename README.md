The use of SQL (Structured Query Language) is not limited to only for database management purpose. The SQL also can be used for analytical purpose. The SQL commands can be used to draw some simple insights. SQL may be considered as one of best choices to be used for gain simple insight quickly.

## **Overview**
In this project explained an analysis about the performance of an e-commerce in South America. There ara three aspects analyzed namely customers growth, products quality, and payment type usage. All of the analysis metrics for the three aspects mentioned are drawn by using PostgreSQL. All of the resources such as SQL script, datasets, and the presentation file are available in this repository.

**Notes:** I know that this project is still far from perfection. If you find something to improve this project, feel free to discuse. My pleasure to consider any suggestioins.
